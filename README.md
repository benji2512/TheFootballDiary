# The Football Diary

Welcome to The Football Diary!
For an overview of the project click [here](Documentation/Overview.md)

But here is the blurb for The Football Diary
> The Football Diary is a digital diary for players of all ages to track their views, physical and mental feelings and rehab of injuries during their season for both training sessions and matches.

I have decided to develop an Android app first and from there will develop an IOS version and eventually a web version.

To keep track of the development process, have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/benji2512/TheFootballDiary/issues) board. If I decide to make this a full on project, I will create a development blog, but until then the issues board is the best place to find updates
